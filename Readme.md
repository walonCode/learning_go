# Golang Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Golang Learning Repository**! 🚀 This repository contains structured lessons on various Go programming topics, each organized into lesson folders with accompanying problem-solving exercises.

## 📂 Folder Structure

The repository follows a structured format where each topic is stored in its respective **lesson folder**, along with a separate **problem folder** for practice.

## 📖 Lessons Overview

### 🔹 Lesson 01: Hello World
- Introduction to Go syntax
- Writing and running a basic Go program

### 🔹 Lesson 02: Types
- Understanding Go's type system
- Primitive types: int, float, string, bool, etc.

### 🔹 Lesson 03: Variables
- Declaring and initializing variables
- Short variable declarations
- Constants

### 🔹 Lesson 04: Control Structures (if-else & loops)
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)
- Loops (`for`, `range`)

### 🔹 Lesson 05: Maps, Slices & Arrays
- Working with arrays
- Slices and their dynamic nature
- Maps for key-value storage

### 🔹 Lesson 06: Functions, Panic & Recover
- Defining and calling functions
- Multiple return values
- Error handling with `panic` and `recover`

### 🔹 Lesson 07: Pointers
- Understanding pointers and memory addresses
- Using pointers with functions

### 🔹 Lesson 08: Structs & Interfaces
- Defining structs for custom data types
- Implementing interfaces for abstraction

### 🔹 Lesson 09: Concurrency
- Learnt about and how it works
- Implemented how two concurrent function can talk to each other

### 🔹 Lesson 10: Packages
- What are packages
- Learnt how to create a packages and  use them in a project

## 📝 Problems Folder
The **problems** folder contains coding challenges related to each lesson to reinforce learning through hands-on practice.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/walonCode/learning_go.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd learning_go
   ```
3. Run Go programs using:
   ```sh
   go run lesson_01/main.go
   ```

## 🎯 Goals
- Build a strong foundation in Golang
- Write clean, efficient, and idiomatic Go code
- Solve real-world problems using Go

## 📌 Future Topics
- Concurrency (goroutines & channels)
- File handling
- Web development with Go
- And more!

Happy coding! 🚀
